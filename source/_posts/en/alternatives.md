title: Alternatives to the LightBlue Bean
---

What other options are there?

<!-- more -->

There are a few boards out there that let you extend an Arduino to have Bluetooth, such as the [Bluefruit LE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1697) by adafruit. However, the only board that I could find that was an Arduino chip + BLE all in one was the [BLEduino](http://bleduino.cc/) made by kytelabs.

This board is based off of the [Arduino Leonardo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLeonardo) whereas the LightBlue Bean is based off of the [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno). It  has Bluetooth 4 LE, a microchip with twice the clock rate, and comparable specs in most other categories. However, I could not find a single place to purchase it, so I cannot attest for price and availability. One other downside is that it does not have a built-in battery like the Bean does, so you would have to add that yourself or power it some other way. Taht aside, the faster clock speed may make it preferable for certain projects.
